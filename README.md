# Purdue IEEE Software Saturdays
Software Saturdays is an event committee hosted jointly by the Purdue University College of Engineering and the IEEE Purdue Student Branch. It aims to teach engineers modern software development skills and programming frameworks that are useful no matter what industry our attendees are a part of. This fall semester, we are teaching Web App Development using ReactJS.
